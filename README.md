    <h2>The Halloween Store</h2>
    <h4>For the little Goblin in all of us!</h4>
    <h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay a while.</h1>
    <p>I started this Website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.<br><br>
    If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
